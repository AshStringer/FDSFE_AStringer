**What was this homework about**
This homework was about working with linear regressions and learning how to pull from data. It was also about making different kinds of plots such as histograms and heat maps. Also using sklearn to make multilinear regressions was important in this homework.

**What was the hardest part of this homework for you?**
The hardest part of this homework for me was using sklearn to find correlated variables with Exam_Scores. Also, making the predicted values and making the plots to correlate with them.

**What was the easiest part of this homework for you?**
The easiest part of this homework for me was reading data from the file using things like describe, corr, shape. Also making the heatmap was easy for me.

**What is one new thing you learned**
A new thing I learned was how to use sklearn even though it was pretty difficult for me.
